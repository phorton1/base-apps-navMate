The semantic data dictionary the DATABASE/DBNAV protocol carries:
TDBItem type catalog, FID enumeration, encoding decisions. Peer of
DATABASE; the substantive content of what the protocol delivers.

FIDS is the semantic data dictionary that the DATABASE/DBNAV
protocol carries. A FID (field ID) identifies a per-source
instance -- "this engine's RPM", "the main compass's heading",
"the speed-through-water reading from the speed sensor." A FID
alone tells you which source supplies a value; it doesn't tell
you how to decode the bytes that follow. That second part -- the
semantic type -- is what the firmware uses internally to wire
together its instrument data system, and it is present on the
wire too, attached to every value the E80 broadcasts.

This doc is about that semantic-type system: what the firmware
knows about its own data items, how that knowledge is exposed on
the wire, and what Patrick can do with it on the `/raymarine/NET`
side.

## The firmware's data-dictionary vocabulary

The firmware uses C++ templates of the form
`TDBItem<T, (UINT16)N, S>` to instantiate its database items.
162 distinct instantiations exist as RTTI typeinfo strings in
the binary, each carrying three template parameters:

- **T** -- a self-documenting semantic type name. Examples:
  `INSTRUMENTS::SPEED_0_01_METRES_PER_SECOND_T`,
  `INSTRUMENTS::ANGLE_0_0001_RAD_T`,
  `INSTRUMENTS::TEMPERATURE_0_01_KELVIN_T`,
  `INSTRUMENT_DATA_ITEMS::PACKED_POSITION_STRUCT_T`. The
  encoding (units, scale, precision) and shape (scalar vs
  packed-struct) is encoded in the name.
- **N** -- a `(UINT16)` constant ranging 0..270 plus a sparse
  set of `0x80xx` values for SIGNED variants. The 0x8000 bit is
  the sign flag.
- **S** -- an encoding marker (`SHORT_STRING`, `LONG_STRING`,
  `POSITION_STRING`, `NO_CONVERSION`, etc.).

The full sorted list of 162 entries is in
`data/tdb_item_by_id.txt`.

## The wrong guess and the right answer

The earliest hope was that the TDBItem N parameter would equal
Patrick's wire FID -- a complete FID-to-semantic-type
dictionary sitting right there in the binary. That hope was
wrong: cross-checking N values against known FIDs showed a clear
mismatch. For example, Patrick's FID 0x03 is SPEED, but TDBItem
N=3 is DATE. The two enumerations are independent.

The correspondence is one level over. **The 2-byte `type` field
in every TFieldRecord on the DBNAV wire IS the firmware's TDBItem
N value.** Patrick's `d_DBNAV.pm decode_field` already unpacks
this field via `unpack('Vvv', ...)` but has treated only the
FID as semantic -- the type has been available all along; it
just hadn't been recognized as the firmware's type tag.

The two dimensions are independent:

- The wire **FID** identifies WHICH source supplies the value
  (which engine, which compass, which wind sensor).
- The wire **TYPE** identifies HOW to decode the value (the
  encoding and units).

The firmware emits both on every broadcast record. The decoder
choice can be driven by the type field rather than guessed
per-fid.

## Patrick's decoder coverage

Of the 162 firmware semantic types:

- **24 types** have a Patrick-side decoder.
- **20 of those 24** are wired up to one or more of Patrick's
  existing FIDs (covering ~62 individual FIDs handled correctly).
- **4 types** have a decoder ready but no FIDs assigned --
  they'll start decoding correctly as soon as a fid of that type
  arrives on the wire.
- **138 types** have no decoder.

The majority of the gap is `PACKED_*_STRUCT` types (GPS / GNSS /
DGNSS / autopilot / trip-parameters / etc.) and BYTE-encoded
enums (settings, modes, unit selectors, chart-display switches).
The scalar primitive gaps worth writing decoders for, when
interesting: FREQUENCY_1_HERTZ (183), FUEL_ECONOMY (212),
POSITION_PRECISION (153), CURRENT_0_1_AMPS (32793), and a few
SIGNED variants.

Examples of types Patrick's decoders correctly handle, by N:

```
N=0   SPEED_0_1_METRES_PER_SECOND       -> deciMetersPerSec
N=1   SPEED_0_01_METRES_PER_SECOND      -> centiMetersPerSec
N=3   DATE                              -> date
N=4   TIME_0_0001_SECONDS               -> time
N=13  DISTANCE_METRES                   -> distanceMeters
N=14  LONG_DISTANCE_0_01_METRES         -> depth/distanceCentiMeters
N=18  TEMPERATURE_0_01_KELVIN           -> kelvinOver100
N=19  TEMPERATURE_0_1_KELVIN            -> kelvinOver10
N=20  PRESSURE_100_PASCAL               -> millibarsToPSI
N=26  REVOLUTION_RATE_0_25_RPM          -> intWordOver4
N=42  ANGLE_0_0001_RAD                  -> heading
N=60  PACKED_POSITION_STRUCT            -> latLon
N=114 WAYPOINT_ID                       -> string
N=115 PACKED_MM_POSITION_STRUCT         -> northEast
N=175 WAYPOINT_NAME                     -> string15
N=211 VOLUME_0_1_LITRE                  -> deciLitresToGallons
```

The table in `data/tdb_item_by_id.txt` is suitable for direct copy
into a Perl hash. The full 162-row table with Patrick's coverage
per row follows below.

## The firmware TYPE universe -- 162 entries, with coverage

Every `TDBItem<T, (UINT16)N, S>` the firmware names, sorted by N,
with a column for "does Patrick have a decoder for this type, and
which FIDs of his does that decoder currently handle." Names are
abbreviated (common prefixes like `INSTRUMENTS::`,
`INSTRUMENT_DATA_ITEMS::`, `UNITS::`, and the trailing `_T`
stripped).

## What this enables

Without further firmware work, `d_DBNAV.pm` can be enhanced today:

1. **Build a `%TDBI_TYPES` Perl hash** from the 162 typeinfo
   entries (one line per entry, N => "T name"). Each entry maps
   an N value to the firmware's own self-documenting type name.
2. **Surface the type alongside the decoded value.** The
   per-record log line for fid 0x17 would show
   `type=ANGLE_0_0001_RAD (N=42)` next to the current heading
   value, making unfamiliar fids self-documenting.
3. **Drive decoder selection by type.** Any fid whose wire type
   is N=42 gets the heading decoder; any N=1 gets the speed
   decoder; etc. Patrick's hand-curated `%DB_FIELDS` becomes a
   per-fid NAME table only; decoder choice unifies across all
   fids by type.

The benefit: observe unknown FIDs and immediately see their
semantic encoding, without needing to reverse-engineer each one.
The per-fid NAME (which engine instance, which wind sensor)
still requires identifying the data source -- but the
"what are these bytes" question is solved.

## What's still open

**Mapping each FID to its firmware-source name** -- so 0x21
becomes the firmware's own name for ENG_OIL_PRESS1 rather than
Patrick's invented label -- did NOT yield to this dig. The
Source's `vmethod_0x8c` (the "get current field value by fid")
is the function that knows how to look up by fid, but its
implementation lives behind a service-locator indirection that
requires identifying the concrete class behind the indirection
to trace. Patrick's FIDs don't appear as simple integer
constants near the TDBItem instantiations the way they do in the
Source constructor's auto-subscribe block, which suggests the
registration table (if it exists as a table at all) is built
by code, not as a static array.

So per-FID firmware-name surfacing remains a future task. The
type-driven decoding above doesn't depend on it.
