Service discovery and instantiation protocol; the complete service
catalog mapped against observed SIDs; the consume-vs-serve
distinction; the gap surface of services that exist in firmware
but are not yet implemented in /raymarine/NET.

RAYDP is the SeatalkHS service-discovery and instantiation
protocol -- the same role on both sides: in Patrick's
`c_RAYDP.pm` (the client receiver and decoder of RAYDP
advertisements) and in the firmware (where service
advertisements dispatch to per-service factories that build
per-service Source objects). This doc is the Patrick-conceptual
view: the service catalog, the consume-vs-serve distinction, the
cross-reference between observed and named services, the gap
surface for /raymarine/NET, and the packet-length variants.

The firmware names in the service catalog below were derived in
Ghidra from types of the form `CLNet*Server`, where `*` is the
firmware name. Example: `CLNetWaypointServer` gives "Waypoint".

## Consume vs serve

A service appearing in the dispatcher's case alphabet means the
E80 knows how to **consume** that service when *another* device
advertises it. The dispatcher creates a `CLNet*Source` (client)
object. Whether the E80 also **serves** that protocol -- hosts
its own `CLNet*Server` and broadcasts itself -- is a separate
firmware-side fact, determined by whether a `CLNet*Server` class
exists in the catalog and is instantiated on boot.

The two are independent. Most services the E80 knows about are
both consumable AND served (Waypoint, Track, Database, etc.).
A few are consume-only -- the E80 can use them from external
devices but doesn't host them.

## The complete service catalog

The firmware's RAYDP advertisement dispatcher has 20 cases,
one per consumable service. Patrick has observed 11 of these
on the wire. Of the 20, **17 are also served** by the E80 (have
a `CLNet*Server` class); **3 are consume-only**.

The full cross-reference is in
`data/raydp_sid_classification.txt`; the table below is the
headline view.

The firmware uses CapFirst single-token names for services in
its internal source code. Patrick's docs sometimes use slightly
different spellings (e.g. "FILESYS" for the firmware's
"CFAccessController", "WPMGR" for "Waypoint", "Auto Pilot"
with a space vs the firmware's "AutoPilot"). The
/raymarine/NET docs have been the long-running source of truth
for the Patrick-side naming.

**A caveat on the serve? column.** The Y in "serve?" means
"a `CLNet*Server` class for this service exists in the firmware
catalog." That's necessary but not sufficient -- a Server class
could exist in code but not be instantiated on a given build.
For all 8 services Patrick has actually connected to (Radar via
piRadar plugin only, FILESYS, Navigation, GPS, AutoPilot via
empirical port observation, WPMGR, Database, Track, Alarm,
HistData), the corresponding Server class is in the catalog --
that confirms the structural test for the cases we can verify.

## The consume-only services

The three consume-only services have a structural rather than
hardware explanation:

- **Flob (sid 20)** -- network-shared blob storage. The E80
  consumes Flob from external storage-class devices (likely
  RNS, dedicated chartplotters with larger flash). The E80's
  internal blob storage uses the same family (`CFlashFlobFsDriver`
  backs `\LOCAL\` persistence) but is not exposed over the
  wire from this device.
- **NavionicsChart (sid 23)** -- chart data. The E80 consumes
  Navionics chart streams from a chart-source service; doesn't
  host its own.
- **DigitalRadar (sid 28)** -- newer-generation digital radar
  units. The E80 talks to them as a client; it doesn't
  emulate a digital radar.

For these three, "not observed" is the architectural answer:
the E80 will *never* advertise them no matter what hardware is
attached, because no Server class exists in the firmware.

## Services not documented in specific *.md files

The services below exist on the wire but do not have their own
abstract document. They are unadvertised -- they have no
`CLNet*ServiceInfo` and do not appear in
`RAYDP_dispatchAdvertisement` -- yet both bind sockets and accept
connections, reachable on the wire if you know where to look.

### Diagnostics

An unadvertised service (sid `0xdddd`) reachable on UDP 6667. It
hosts its own `CLNetDiagnosticsServer` with a paired
`CLNetDiagnosticsConnection` -- the standard CLNet wire-service
shape, minus the `CLNet*ServiceInfo` (which is why it carries no
catalog sid and does not advertise). The wire protocol is decoded
and wire-tested, with a live round-trip verified against E80-4.

Its command structure is the familiar RAYNET shape, very close to
FILESYS: a 4-byte command word whose high word is the service id,
followed by the reply port carried IN the request -- the same
reply-port-in-request convention FILESYS uses, where the client
binds a UDP listener on a chosen local port and puts that port in
the request, and the server replies there rather than to the UDP
source port. (The one simplification relative to FILESYS is that
no sequence field is carried.)

A request laid out as it appears on the wire (little-endian) --
here the ECHO command with an example reply port 11000 and an
8-byte payload:

```
00 00 DD DD F8 2A 08 00 DE AD BE EF 01 02 03 04
^^ ^^                                             <- opcode 0x0000 (ECHO) -- low word of command word
      ^^ ^^                                       <- service id 0xdddd -- high word of command word
            ^^ ^^                                 <- reply port 11000 = 0x2AF8 (v, LE), carried in the request
                  ^^ ^^                           <- payload length 8 (v, LE)
                        ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^   <- 8-byte payload (echoed back)
```

The first four bytes form the command word `0xdddd0000`: the high
word `0xdddd` is the service id -- the same slot where FILESYS
carries `0x0005` -- and the low word is the opcode. Responses for
commands that reply carry magic `0xdddd0100`, then the device's
4-byte RAYDP ID, then `length(2) + payload`.

Three opcodes are characterized:

- **0x00 -- ECHO.** Bounces the payload back to the reply port.
  Safe; used to confirm reachability.
- **0x05 -- CHECKSUM-VERIFY.** Computes an XOR checksum over the
  payload and returns a bool to the caller; no wire response, no
  observable side effect.
- **0x06 -- N2K-BUS PGN INSERTION.** The 12-byte payload (4-byte
  CAN identifier LE + 8 data bytes) is laid into an internal CAN
  frame and handed to `n2kBus_dispatchFrame` -- the same routine
  the on-device N2K worker thread calls after dequeueing from the
  CAN ISR's RX queue. A single unauthenticated UDP datagram places
  an arbitrary well-formed frame onto the device's internal
  dispatch path with no attached hardware. Confirmed against
  E80-4 -- PGN 128267 (Water Depth) carrying 12.34 m drove the
  on-screen depth to 40.5 ft, re-confirmed on a fresh boot with no
  external N2K node present, so the insertion needs no live source
  on the bus and no prior address-claim for the frame's source
  address. For PDU2 broadcast PGNs the source address is not
  filtered; the only gates are the device's own N2K being active
  and the target PGN having a registered handler. The inserted
  frame is NOT re-broadcast onto the physical CAN wire -- the TX
  scheduler only periodically broadcasts the device's own measured
  PGNs.

The listener dispatches exactly these three opcodes; any other
command word falls through and is silently ignored. `0x01`..`0x04`
and `0x07`+ are not hidden operations -- there are no other
commands on this listener.

### DiagnosticTCP

The unadvertised TCP companion to Diagnostics, on TCP 6668. The
same `CLNetDiagnosticsServer` that hosts the UDP 6667 listener
also binds a stream (TCP) socket on 6668 (`listen` backlog 5) and
runs an accept loop; each accepted connection gets its own worker
thread. Wire-tested against E80-4.

The message is the SAME diagnostics frame as Diagnostics, but
wrapped in a 2-byte little-endian length prefix (both
directions), and only the `0xdddd0000` ECHO command is
implemented -- any other command word is read and silently
dropped. This is why a casual TCP probe sees nothing: only a
correctly-framed ECHO elicits a reply.

A confirmed ECHO round-trip (payload "ECHO-6668-TEST"):

```
request:
16 00 00 00 dd dd 00 00 0e 00 45 43 48 4f ...
^^ ^^                                          <- frame length 0x0016 (LE): bytes that follow
      ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^                              <- command word 0xdddd0000
                  ^^ ^^                        <- offset 4-5 (UDP reply-port slot; unused over TCP)
                        ^^ ^^                  <- payload length 0x000e = 14 (LE)
                              ^^ ^^ ...         <- payload

response:
18 00 00 01 dd dd 00 00 00 00 0e 00 45 43 48 4f ...
^^ ^^                                                <- frame length 0x0018 = 24 (LE)
      ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^                                    <- magic 0xdddd0100
                  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^                        <- device id (0x00000000 over TCP)
                              ^^ ^^                  <- payload length 0x000e = 14 (LE)
                                    ^^ ^^ ...         <- echoed payload
```

The inner frame after the length prefix is identical in shape to
the UDP 6667 protocol. One divergence from the UDP path: the
4-byte device-id field comes back zero over TCP, whereas the UDP
echo returns the device's RAYDP ID.

## The gap surface

What this catalog gives is **completeness** plus the
serve-vs-consume distinction. Of the services in the
firmware's case alphabet:

- **Implemented in /raymarine/NET (Patrick consumes them
  from the E80):** WPMGR, TRACK, FILESYS, Database (+DBNAV),
  Navigation, Alarm. Each is both consumed AND served by the
  E80; Patrick has decoded the wire protocols and has Perl-side
  machinery.
- **Previously observed-only (now named):** GPS, AutoPilot,
  DataMaster. Each is served by the E80; Patrick observed traffic
  but lacks decoders. The firmware-side machinery is the standard
  CLNet pattern; see
  [architecture/services](../architecture/services.md).
- **Decoded but not yet implemented in /raymarine/NET:** HistData
  (see [FishHistory](FishHistory.md)) -- command structure and
  buffer geometry decoded from firmware; no /NET decoder yet.
- **Served by the E80 but not observed (hardware-dependent):**
  Radar, Sonar2, Sonar3, AIS. Attaching the corresponding
  hardware would cause the E80 to start advertising. DGPS,
  Compass, Navtex may also fall in this category, possibly
  with software-dependent triggers.
- **Consume-only (will never advertise):** Flob, NavionicsChart,
  DigitalRadar -- listed above.
- **Unadvertised wire services:** see [Services not documented in
  specific *.md files] above. The Diagnostics service (UDP 6667)
  and DiagnosticTCP (TCP 6668) -- both protocol-decoded and
  wire-tested -- exist outside the SID catalog; reachable but not
  surface-able via the standard dispatcher's case alphabet.

The most concrete near-term opportunities are the
previously-observed-served services (GPS, AutoPilot,
DataMaster). Each is a candidate for a new /NET decoder.

## RAYDP packet-length variants

The per-case length checks in the dispatcher confirm the
empirically-derived packet length variants in
`/raymarine/NET/docs/RAYDP.md`, with one new finding:

| Length    | Variant                                  | Used by |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 0x1c (28) | single ip:port                           | Waypoint, Track, Flob, HistData, Database (single-port) |
| 0x24 (36) | mcast + tcp ip:port pair                 | Radar, GPS, DGPS, Compass, Alarm, DigitalRadar, AIS, Sonar2 |
| 0x25 (37) | 36 + flags byte                          | CFAccessController/FILESYS |
| 0x28 (40) | tcp ip + two ports + mcast ip:port       | Database, AutoPilot, NavionicsChart, Navtex, DataMaster |
| 0x34 (52) | new variant -- not previously observed   | Sonar3 |

The 52-byte variant is the new finding -- specific to Sonar3,
it suggests the Sonar3 advertisement carries more state than
the existing variants (possibly a second channel ip:port pair,
or a hardware-config byte field). The Sonar3 factory body has
not yet been decompiled to confirm.

## Discovery flow

The firmware-side discovery flow for incoming advertisements:

```
RAYDP advertisement arrives at 224.0.0.1:5800
  -> CLNetServiceManager processes it
  -> RAYDP_dispatchAdvertisement switches on sid
  -> RAYDP_allocService does RB-tree lookup-or-insert by device_id
  -> per-service factory builds the lightweight Source registration
```

Separately, on boot:

```
each served service constructs its CLNet*Server
  -> Server creates its threads, sockets, connection table
  -> Server registers with CLNetServiceManager for advertisement
  -> the E80 begins broadcasting RAYDP advertisements for it
```

The Diagnostics service sits outside both flows: it has no
`CLNet*ServiceInfo`, so it neither dispatches through
`RAYDP_dispatchAdvertisement` nor advertises on boot. It was
found not by observing the wire but by the type-matching scan
over the `CLNet*Server` family in the firmware -- a Server class
with no matching ServiceInfo -- and then reading its listener
directly.

This mirrors what `/raymarine/NET/c_RAYDP.pm` does on the
client side: receive advertisements, dispatch by sid, build
per-service descriptors, populate a service registry. The
firmware-side Server constructors are the equivalent of what
/NET implements as per-service modules (d_WPMGR, d_TRACK,
d_FILESYS, etc.).

## Service-internal architecture

The firmware-side architecture of how each service is
structured internally -- the CLNet five-class set
(Server/Source/ServiceInfo/Connection/Backup), the ThreadX
kernel wrappers, the two-object pattern, the inlined
serviceLoop dispatch -- is documented in
[architecture/services](../architecture/services.md). The
per-service specifics for individual protocols are in their
respective abstracts docs ([WPMGR](WPMGR.md),
[TRACK](TRACK.md), [FILESYS](FILESYS.md),
[DATABASE](DATABASE.md), [FIDS](FIDS.md)).
